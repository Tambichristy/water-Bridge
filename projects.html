            Acted teams are devoted to supporting vulnerable communities throughout
             the world and accompanying them in building a better future by providing a
              response adapted to specific needs. Our staff provides aid to populations affected
               by crisis using an approach that is both local and global, multidisciplinary and adapted to 
               each context. By ensuring the link between Emergency, Rehabilitation and Development,
                Acted teams 
               guaranty that interventions made in a situation of crisis are useful and sustainable,
                because only long term support – by remaining in the area post emergency
             and involving communities – can end the poverty cycle and support populations on the road to
