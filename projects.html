               creation of public taps
                public tap creation is one of the ways <br>
                to remedy the problems.
                if we invest in creation of public taps <br>
                in the areas that are affected it will reduce the rate <br>
                of water scarcity and water contamination <br>

            creation of bore holes is also one of the remedy <br>

            bore holes cann be treated so as to give <br>
            good water ...although some bore holes are perfectly clean <br>
            locals of the communities cann also be trained on how to do the drilling.  <br>
